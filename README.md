This web interface displays trading strategy counts based on selected views (*Bullish*, *Bearish*) and dates. Users choose a view and date, and the app shows the count of each strategy (e.g., *Bull Call Spread*). If no strategies exist, it displays "No Strategy." Styled menus and dropdowns enhance readability for quick strategy review.
